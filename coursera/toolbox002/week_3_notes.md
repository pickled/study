# Week 3 Notes

## Types of Questions

### Descriptive a set of data

* Goal : Describe a set of data

----

### Exploratory

* Goal : Find relationships you didn't know about

** Correlation does not imply causion **

---

### Inferential 

* Goal : Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population

---

### Predictive 

* Goal : To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object

not cause <-> effect relation

more data and a simple model _works really well_

---

### Causal

* Goal : to find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change

usually randomized studies are required to identify causation


"gold standard"

---

### Mechanistic 

* Goal : Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects

## What is Data

"data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items"

variables : a measurement of charaacteristic of an item

qualitative : country or origin, sex

quantitative : Height

** Question ** : most important thing

** Data ** : second important thing

## Experimental Design


[실험계획법](http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%8B%A4%ED%97%98%EA%B3%84%ED%9A%8D%EB%B2%95)

"특히 실험의 특성에 영향을 미치는 여러 가지 인자를 알아 내야 하고 인자간의 관계를 알아보기 위한 실험을 하여 데이터를 얻어내고 이를 분석하여 최적화된 올바른 행동방안을 만들어 합리적인 방법을 통해 신뢰할 수 있는 실험을 만들어 낸다.

이때 효과적인 실험은 경제적으로 효율적이며 올바른 결과를 만들어 낼 수 있다."

confounding

confound : If someone or something confounds you, they make you feel surprised or confused, often by showing you that your opinions or expectations of them were wrong.

S -> L

S <- A -> L


**Correlation is not causation**

### Randomization and blocking

prediction versus inference

### Prediction key quantities

Sensitivity -> Pr (positive test | disease)

Specificity -> Pr (negative test | no disease)

Positive Predictive Value -> Pr (disease | positive test)

Negative Predictive Value -> Pr (no disease | negative test)

Accuracy -> Pr (correct outcome)

### Beware data dredging

acne : If someone has acne, they have a skin condition which causes a lot of spots on their face and neck.


### Summary

* Good experiments
 1. have replication
 2. meaure variability
 3. generalize to the problem you care about
 4. are transparent
 
* Prediction is not inference
 1. both can be important
 
* Beware data dredging
